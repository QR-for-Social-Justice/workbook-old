  <title>Getting Started</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>If you’re new to incorporating social justice issues into math classes, I’d encourage you to start by reading or skimming Jonathan Osler’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tz6Tc0Ug44OyAN_WFRODFT-LNRRQBCnS/view?usp=sharing">“A Guide for Integrating Issues of Social and Economic Justice into Mathematics Curriculum”</a>, made by a high-school educator but equally relevant in the postsecondary context. Next, Drew Winter’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hui9iITN5yD8D32aniSSDH73PvOoS8GQ/view?usp=sharing">“Infusing Mathematics with Culture”</a> offers a valuable framework for thinking about the relationship between mathematical content and social justice issues, as well as an emphasis on connecting to student activism and interests.

    <p>
      This book is meant to be used as a workbook for students in a quantitative reasoning (QR) course framed around issues of social justice (SJ). This course developed out of my <a href="https://kenanince.org/OER4SJ">resource folder for open-access SJ math resources</a>; feel free to mix and match chapters from this book and resources from the folder to plug into existing courses as well as to "remix" your own full course.
