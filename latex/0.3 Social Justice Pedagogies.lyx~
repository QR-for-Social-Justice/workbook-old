Stopped for Effect: The Urgency of Active Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would be remiss to fail to include a section on pedagogies that have
 been repeatedly shown in studies and large meta-analyses to improve learning
 for all students, particularly minoritized students.
 In a

 referred to as ``active learning'', improved student performance by half
 a letter grade, while lecturing results in a 
\begin_inset Formula $55\%$

 increase in student failure rates compared to active learning and the odds
 ratio for failing was

.
 Famously, the study concludes that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
If the experiments analyzed here had been conducted as randomized controlled
 trials of medical interventions, they may have been stopped for benefit—meaning
 that enrolling patients in the control condition might be discontinued
 because the treatment being tested was clearly more beneficial.
 For example, a recent analysis of 143 randomized controlled medical trials
 that were stopped for benefit found that they had a median relative risk
 of 0.52, with a range of 0.22 to 0.66.
 In addition, best-practice directives suggest that data management committees
 may allow such studies to stop for benefit if interim analyses have large
 sample sizes and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 values under 
\begin_inset Formula $0.001$
\end_inset

.
 Both criteria were met for failure rates in the education studies we analyzed:
 The average relative risk was 0.64 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 value on the overall odds ratio was 
\begin_inset Formula $<<0.001$

.

Additionally, the benefits of active learning are felt disproportionately
 by students from groups underrepresented in STEM.

 found that ``achievement gaps'' in exam scores were decreased by 
\begin_inset Formula $33\%$
\end_inset

 under active learning, while gaps in passing rates decreased by 
\begin_inset Formula $45\%$
\end_inset

.
 The study emphasizes the urgency of adopting inclusive teaching practices:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Underrepresentation in STEM is primarily due to attrition.
 Underrepresented minority (URM) students in the United States, for example,
 start college with the same level of interest in STEM majors as their overrepre
sented peers, but 6-y STEM completion rates drop from 52% for Asian Americans
 and 43% for Caucasians to 22% for African Americans, 29% for Latinx, and
 25% for Native Americans.
 Disparities in STEM degree attainment are also pronounced for low-income
 versus higher-income students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly, improvements in performance were only observed for students
 that participated in ``high-intensity active learning''—meaning those in
 which a great deal of class time involved students engaged in activities
 designed to help them construct their own knowledge.
 Per the Discussion section:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
We propose that two key elements are required to design and implement STEM
 courses that reduce, eliminate, or reverse achievement gaps: deliberate
 practice and a culture of inclusion.
 Deliberate practice emphasizes 1) extensive and highly focused efforts
 geared toward improving performance—meaning that students work hard on
 relevant tasks, 2) scaffolded exercises designed to address specific deficits
 in understanding or skills, 3) immediate feedback, and 4) repetition (49).
 These are all facets of evidence-based best practice in active learning
 (38, 50, 51).
 Equally important, inclusive teaching emphasizes treating students with
 dignity and respect (52), communicating confidence in students’ ability
 to meet high standards (53), and demonstrating a genuine interest in students’
 intellectual and personal growth and success (54, 55).

So What Is ``Active Learning''?

 However, certain pedagogies and interventions show up repeatedly in the
 literature as particularly effective.
 I am indebted to Josh Eyler and the Rice University Center for Teaching
 Excellence in my own journey to learn and implement evidence-based pedagogies.
 The book 
\emph on
What the Best College Teachers Do
\emph default
 provides a digestible summary, as does Josh's book 
\emph on
How Humans Learn.
 
\emph default
The ideas below are heavily influenced by each of these sources as well
 as my own experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First and foremost, the best teachers are empathetic and inclusive.
 In particular, they believe that every student can learn, and that learning
 cannot happen with ``productive failure''.
 Grounded in this philosophy, effective teachers make space for all students
 to try and fail and try again in low-stakes environments.
 This often involves allowing students to correct assignments/exams and
 certainly not repeatedly giving high-stakes assessments without providing
 time for students to reflect and correct mistakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In pedagogies such as 
\emph on
inquiry-based learning 
\emph default
in mathematics and POGIL in computer science, a mixture of instructor feedback
 and peer instruction is involved.
 Many inquiry-based math courses involve students presenting on the board
 to the rest of the class, after which respectful student feedback is solicited.
 Peer instruction helps avoid the 
\emph on
expert blind spot,
\emph default
 when instructors forget what was most confusing in their own learning process
 after years of professional experience and fail to emphasize potential
 problem areas to students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Students bring their own prior knowledge into every course they take.
 In order to promote learning–which necessitates a change in mental models–it's
 important to invest time in getting to know students' schemata related
 to your subject and meet students where they are.
 This often involves 
\emph on
metacognition
\emph default
, or thinking about thinking, both modeled by the instructor (``what do
 you notice? What do you wonder?'') and encouraged on assignments (e.g.
 through required reflections when students revise and resubmit assignments).
 In math, this sometimes involves 
\emph on
teaching the paradoxes
\emph default
–as mathematicians, we value paradox for the inaccuries it points out in
 our own thinking, and it's worth passing this tool on to our students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contemporary definitions of active learning are rooted in the educational
 theory of 
\emph on
constructivism
\emph default
, in which we all build our own knowledge and the best way to learn is to
 be handed the building blocks.
 Most educational researchers agree that some level of instructor guidance
 is necessary for students to learn to put together the building blocks
 and build theoretical structures, and even what is thankfully less frequently
 called the ``full Moore method'' incorporates some level of instructor
 guidance, at least when providing feedback on proofs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increasingly, researchers emphasize that 
\emph on
lecturing 
\emph default
does not in itself constitute bad pedagogy; indeed, the frequency and level
 of interactivity of a lecture is essential in determining how effective
 it is.
 
\emph on
Mini-lectures
\emph default
 of around 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 minutes at a time, interspersed with group work on authentic, challenging
 problems, can be an effective course structure.
 Mini-lectures are a particularly good place to introduce definitions or
 foundational theorems, as well as to offer students a ``guided tour'' of
 more difficult topics.
 Making time for students to ask questions during lectures–and even calling
 on students or groups to share their responses to a lecture–help
