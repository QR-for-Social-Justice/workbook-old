Welcome to the workbook's GitHub page! This is a work in progress, though I hope it is helpful to you. I believe this is the first attempt to collect together resources for a quantitative reasoning course framed around social justice (specifically targeted at higher-ed math faculty) as possible. I am indebted to and model my work after the K-12 educators (e.g. Bob Moses, Jonathan Osler) who have been doing this work for decades.

The book itself is currently hosted [on my website](https://cs.westminstercollege.edu/~kince/qr4sj/). Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:kince@westminstercollege.edu) if you have comments, questions, or suggestions!
