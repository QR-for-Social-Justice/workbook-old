</h3>What do you think of when you think of social justice? What are 2-3 issues of SJ you're passionate about? Can we develop a working definition of SJ as a class?<div class="solutions">
<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref answer-knowl original" data-refid="hk-answer-1" id="answer-1"><span class="type">Answer</span><span class="period">.</span></a><div class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore" id="hk-answer-1"><div class="answer solution-like">
<p id="p-10">Some possible answers:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-4"><p id="p-derived-li-4">justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society. (Google Dictionary)</p></li>
<li id="li-5"><p id="p-derived-li-5">a concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society. (Wikipedia)</p></li>
<li id="li-6"><p id="p-derived-li-6">a state or doctrine of egalitarianism (Merriam-Webster)</p></li>
<li id="li-7"><p id="p-derived-li-7">A broad term for action intended to create genuine equality, fairness and respect among peoples. (University of Massachusetts Lowell Department of Multicultural Affairs)</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-11">One working definition that my classes have used (due to Sensoy-DiAngelo) is the following. Social justice is a recognition that:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-8"><p id="p-derived-li-8">all people are individuals, but we are also members of socially constructed groups;</p></li>
<li id="li-9"><p id="p-derived-li-9">society is stratified, and social groups are valued unequally;</p></li>
<li id="li-10"><p id="p-derived-li-10">social groups that are valued more highly have greater access to resources and this access is structured into the institutions and cultural norms;</p></li>
<li id="li-11"><p id="p-derived-li-11">social injustice is real and exists today;</p></li>
<li id="li-12"><p id="p-derived-li-12">relations of unequal power are constantly being enacted at both the micro (individual) and macro (structural) levels;</p></li>
<li id="li-13"><p id="p-derived-li-13">we are all socialized to be complicit in these relations;</p></li>
<li id="li-14"><p id="p-derived-li-14">those who claim to be for social justice must strategically act from that claim in ways that challenge social injustice; and</p></li>
<li id="li-15"><p id="p-derived-li-15">this action requires a commitment to an ongoing and lifelong process.</p></li>

<p id="p-13">You may have come up with questions similar to the following:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-16"><p id="p-derived-li-16">How did we measure X?</p></li>
<li id="li-17"><p id="p-derived-li-17">What's the best way to measure X?</p></li>

<p id="p-14">We just demonstrated a couple of tools we'll use many times in the next week or two:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-20"><p id="p-derived-li-20">Estimation: round up or down to make calculations easier and numbers less messy. As we saw when estimating the number of classrooms needed for the US household wealth, rounding before the computation ends can introduce error. Therefore, if you have a calculator, it's best to plug into the calculator before rounding, whereas if you're computing by hand, rounding may be necessary in order to increase the accuracy of your computations. Everyone makes arithmetic mistakes–you'll see me do it plenty of times!</p></li>
<li id="li-21"><p id="p-derived-li-21">Dimensional analysis: start with the given and multiply by fractions, canceling out the units, until you get something in the units your answer should be in. This is almost always your answer!</p></li>

</h3>Get in groups of size 3–4. Group members should introduce themselves - name, pronouns, hobbies outside school, goals for the semester/year, reason they're taking the course. For each of the questions that follow, I will ask you to: <ol class="decimal">

The responses to the first two questions are usually what you would expect. Question 3 always generates great discussions. The idea of “productive failure” naturally arises when discussing question 4 and I provide them with this language sometime while discussing this question. Listening to the students’ responses to question 4 is awesome. It’s really nice to get the students establishing the necessary culture of the class without me having to tell them what to do.</p> <p id="p-17">After we are done discussing the 5 questions, I elaborate on the importance of productive failure and inform that I will often tag things in class with the hashtag #pf in an attempt to emphasize its value. I also provide them with the following quote from Mike Starbird: “Any creative endeavor is built on the ash heap of failure.” I wrap up the activity by conveying some claims I make about education and stating some of my goals as a teacher.</p> <p id="p-18">Claims</p><ul class="disc">
<li id="li-29"><p id="p-derived-li-29">An education must prepare a student to ask and explore questions in contexts that do not yet exist. That is, we need individuals capable of tackling problems they have never encountered and to ask questions no one has yet thought of.</p></li>

<section class="introduction" id="introduction-5">There is some evidence that the use of group roles, in which all group members rotate assigned tasks each day, improves student learning<a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-17" id="fn-17"><sup> 17 </sup></a> Additionally, in a course that discusses sensitive political topics, my experience has emphasized the importance of agreeing on discussion norms before beginning a sensitive discussion.

<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.2.1.1</span> <span class="title">Ground rules</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-19">Given the nature of this course, it’s important that we develop class norms to promote an atmosphere which will facilitate the learning process as well as respect the experiences of different groups in the classroom and the larger society. The class can agree to revise them and add others, but all students must commit themselves to the final set of rules by the end of the first class. These principles will guide our class discussions and interactions.</p>
<article class="exercise exercise-like" id="exercise-4"></article><p id="p-25">Here are some useful classroom norms:</p> <ol id="p-26" class="decimal">
<li id="li-34">
<p id="p-27"><dfn class="terminology">Controversy and vulnerability</dfn>: different views are expected and honored with a group commitment to understand the sources of disagreement and to work cooperatively toward common solutions <dfn class="terminology">without putting a disproportionate responsibility on marginalized groups to educate us</dfn>.</p>
<ul id="p-28" class="disc">
<li id="li-35"><p id="p-29">No one’s identities are under question: e.g. no arguing that queer people are wrong for existing.</p></li>
<li id="li-36"><p id="p-30">Please come talk to your instructor anytime you feel uncomfortable enough that it’s affecting your work in class.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="li-37"><p id="p-31"><dfn class="terminology">Own your intentions and your impact.</dfn> Acknowledge that the impact of your actions is not always congruent with your intentions and that positive or neutral intentions do not trump negative impact. Participate truthfully and accept when your actions or words harm others.</p></li>
<li id="li-38"><p id="p-32"><dfn class="terminology">Challenge by choice</dfn>: individuals may determine for themselves if and to what degree they will participate in a given discussion or activity. It is possible not to participate in a few activities and still receive an A in the course. Be aware of what factors influence your decision about whether to challenge yourself on a given issue.</p></li>
<li id="li-39"><p id="p-33"><dfn class="terminology">Respect</dfn>: each other and yourselves. Investigate how your cultural context affects what you think of as respect for others and acknowledge what respect looks like in other contexts.</p></li>
<li id="li-40"><p id="p-34"><dfn class="terminology">No attacks</dfn>. personal attacks are a form of extreme disrespect. Disagreeing with ideas is welcome; attacking individuals for their ideas is not.</p></li>
