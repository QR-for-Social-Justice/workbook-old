<p>Some possible answers:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society. (Google Dictionary)</p></li>
<li><p>a concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society. (Wikipedia)</p></li>
<li><p>a state or doctrine of egalitarianism (Merriam-Webster)</p></li>
<li><p>A broad term for action intended to create genuine equality, fairness and respect among peoples. (University of Massachusetts Lowell Department of Multicultural Affairs)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One working definition that my classes have used (due to Sensoy-DiAngelo) is the following. Social justice is a recognition that:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>all people are individuals, but we are also members of socially constructed groups;</p></li>
<li><p>society is stratified, and social groups are valued unequally;</p></li>
<li><p>social groups that are valued more highly have greater access to resources and this access is structured into the institutions and cultural norms;</p></li>
<li><p>social injustice is real and exists today;</p></li>
<li><p>relations of unequal power are constantly being enacted at both the micro (individual) and macro (structural) levels;</p></li>
<li><p>we are all socialized to be complicit in these relations;</p></li>
<li><p>those who claim to be for social justice must strategically act from that claim in ways that challenge social injustice; and</p></li>
<li><p>this action requires a commitment to an ongoing and lifelong process.</p></li>
</ul>
