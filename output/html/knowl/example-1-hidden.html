<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>What are some social justice issues that are important to you in the midst of rising inequality and authoritarianism, climate crisis, racial justice movements, and more?</p></li>
<li><p>What are some ways we could measure each of these issues? (how bad they are, solutions, societal reactions, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>What are some things you don't know how to measure about each of these issues?</p></li>
<li><p>Estimate: what are some strategies for measuring these things? Don't try to plug in numbers yet, just make a list.</p></li>
<li><p>What are some ways to, as accurately as possible, measure how severe the COVID-19 outbreak is in your city? Write down any assumptions you make about what “severe” means.</p></li>
<li><p>If you were a disability rights activist concerned about the dangers of COVID-19 for immunocompromised folks, which of these ways would you choose to measure? Estimate or find the info.</p></li>
<li><p>If you were an administrator at your college or university, which of these ways would you choose to measure? Explain, then estimate or find the info.</p></li>
<li><p>What are some things it would be ideal to be able to measure in order to curtail or prevent the spread of COVID-19 in your city? Do the same as above: how would you measure these things as a disability rights activist? As a college administrator?</p></li>
<li><p>Brainstorm some ways to obtain the measurements you described above. If you obtained these measurements, how could you use them to advocate for positive change?</p></li>
<li><p>What questions about social justice, health/accessibility, and math does this activity bring up for you?</p></li>
